## üîÆ Phase 8: Future Implementation (NOT STARTED)

### Staff Routes Implementation
- [ ] Add authentication middleware
  - [ ] Verify user is authenticated
  - [ ] Extract user role and ID
  - [ ] Block non-staff users
- [ ] Implement Staff GET /api/staff/revenue
  - [ ] Filter revenues by staff user context
  - [ ] Only show revenues created by staff
  - [ ] Add pagination

- [ ] Implement Staff POST /api/staff/revenue
  - [ ] Restrict to BUS_TRIP revenue only
  - [ ] Validate staff has permission for the bus trip
  - [ ] Use admin validation helper
  - [ ] Create audit log with [Staff] prefix

  - [ ] Verify revenue was created by staff user
  - [ ] Return 403 if user lacks access
  - [ ] Include limited relations (no GL data)
- [ ] Keep Staff PUT and DELETE as HTTP 403 (no implementation needed)

### Staff Helpers Implementation
- [ ] Implement `validateStaffAccess(revenueId, staffUserId)`
  - [ ] Check if revenue.createdBy === staffUserId
  - [ ] Or check if revenue is associated with staff's employee record
  - [ ] Return boolean
- [ ] Implement `getStaffRevenues(staffUserId, filters)`
  - [ ] Build WHERE clause with createdBy filter
  - [ ] Apply additional filters (date, source, etc.)
  - [ ] Return revenue list
- [ ] Implement `createStaffBusTripRevenue(busTripCacheId, staffUserId)`
  - [ ] Validate staff has permission for bus trip
  - [ ] Reuse admin helper logic
  - [ ] Add staff-specific checks
  - [ ] Create audit log with [Staff] prefix

### RBAC Middleware
- [ ] Create `lib/middleware/auth.ts`
  - [ ] Extract user from session/token
  - [ ] Verify user is authenticated
  - [ ] Return user object
- [ ] Create `lib/middleware/rbac.ts`
  - [ ] Check user role (Admin, Staff, etc.)
  - [ ] Verify user has permission for resource
  - [ ] Return 403 if unauthorized
- [ ] Apply middleware to all routes
  - [ ] Admin routes: Require Admin role
  - [ ] Staff routes: Require Staff role
  - [ ] Block unauthenticated users

### Error Handler Integration
- [ ] Update Admin routes to use `handleApiError()`
  - [ ] Replace try/catch error handling
  - [ ] Use `throw new ApiError()` for custom errors
  - [ ] Return consistent error responses
- [ ] Update Staff routes to use `handleApiError()`
  - [ ] Same as Admin routes

### Response Formatter Integration
- [ ] Update Admin routes to use response formatters
  - [ ] Replace `NextResponse.json()` with `formatSuccessResponse()`
  - [ ] Use `formatPaginatedResponse()` for list endpoints
  - [ ] Use `formatCreatedResponse()` for create endpoints
  - [ ] Use `formatErrorResponse()` for error responses
- [ ] Update Staff routes to use response formatters
