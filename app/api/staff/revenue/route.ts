/**
 * Staff Revenue API Route (PLACEHOLDER)
 * Path: /api/staff/revenue
 * 
 * TODO: Implement staff-specific revenue operations
 * Staff should have limited access compared to Admin:
 * - READ: View revenues within their assigned scope only
 * - CREATE: Limited to specific revenue types (e.g., BUS_TRIP only)
 * - UPDATE: Not allowed or very limited
 * - DELETE: Not allowed
 * 
 * Expected behavior:
 * 1. Staff can only view revenues they are associated with
 * 2. Staff can create bus trip revenues (their primary use case)
 * 3. Staff cannot edit or delete any revenue records
 * 4. Staff cannot access posted/GL-related operations
 * 
 * Implementation notes:
 * - Add role-based access control (RBAC) checks
 * - Filter data based on staff user's employee ID
 * - Use shared validation and helper functions from lib/admin/revenues/
 * - Staff-specific business rules to be defined
