/**
 * Staff Single Revenue API Route (PLACEHOLDER)
 * Path: /api/staff/revenue/[id]
 * 
 * TODO: Implement staff-specific single revenue operations
 * Staff should have very limited access:
 * - READ: View only if within their scope
 * - UPDATE: Not allowed
 * - DELETE: Not allowed
 * 
 * Expected behavior:
 * 1. Staff can only view revenues they created or are associated with
 * 2. Staff cannot modify any revenue records
 * 3. Staff cannot delete any revenue records
 * 4. Access checks based on staff user ID and revenue ownership
 * 
 * Implementation notes:
 * - Add role-based access control (RBAC) checks
 * - Verify revenue ownership/association before allowing access
 * - Return 403 Forbidden if user doesn't have access
